## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Multi-platform rally management system for organizers and participants
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Rally Masters, Rally Riders, Scorers
   ‚Üí Actions: Rally creation, bonus point management, ride planning, navigation, scoring
   ‚Üí Data: Rallies, bonus points, combinations, riders, scores
   ‚Üí Constraints: Offline capability, multiple platforms, route optimization
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flows for rally creation, ride planning, and scoring identified
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement is testable and specific to user needs
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Rally, BonusPoint, Combination, Rider, Score entities defined
7. Run Review Checklist

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Rally Masters need to organize motorcycle rallies by creating bonus point locations and scoring combinations. Rally Riders participate by planning optimal routes through these points to maximize their scores within time constraints. Scorers evaluate rider submissions and calculate final results.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a Rally Master wants to create a new rally, **When** they define basic rally information and bonus points, **Then** the system stores the rally data and makes it available for riders to discover
2. **Given** bonus points and combinations are defined, **When** a Rally Rider plans their route, **Then** the system displays an interactive map with color-coded points and allows route optimization
3. **Given** a rally is in progress, **When** a rider navigates using the mobile app, **Then** the system provides turn-by-turn directions and real-time timing updates even without cellular coverage
4. **Given** a rally has ended, **When** scorers input rider submissions, **Then** the system calculates points for individual bonus points and completed combinations automatically
5. **Given** multiple scorers are working simultaneously, **When** they complete their scoring sessions, **Then** the system consolidates all scores into a unified leaderboard

### Edge Cases
- What happens when GPS coordinates for bonus points are incorrect or inaccessible?
- How does the system handle riders who claim points that scorers cannot verify?
- What occurs when rally data needs to be updated after riders have already downloaded it?
- How does navigation continue when mobile devices lose all connectivity?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Rally Management**
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow Rally Masters to create new rallies with basic information (name, description, dates, location)
- **FR-002**: System MUST enable Rally Masters to define bonus points with names, abbreviations, GPS coordinates, descriptions, addresses, and point values
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow Rally Masters to create combinations of bonus points that yield additional points when completed
- **FR-004**: Rally Masters MUST be able to choose between local data storage and server-based storage for each rally
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain encrypted preferences and rally history for Rally Masters

**Rider Registration & Discovery**
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow riders to search for and discover available rallies
- **FR-007**: System MUST enable riders to register for rallies they wish to participate in
- **FR-008**: System MUST assign unique rider numbers to registered participants

**Route Planning**
- **FR-009**: System MUST import rally data from multiple sources including server downloads, CSV files, and manual entry
- **FR-010**: System MUST display an interactive map showing all bonus points with visual differentiation for different combinations
- **FR-011**: System MUST allow riders to toggle visibility of bonus points based on combination membership or individual selection
- **FR-012**: System MUST enable geographical filtering where riders can select/deselect combinations based on location proximity
- **FR-013**: System MUST support alternative sub-routes for dynamic route adjustment during rallies
- **FR-014**: System MUST export planned routes in multiple formats for external GPS devices and mapping applications

**Navigation & Real-Time Assistance**
- **FR-015**: Mobile system MUST provide offline navigation capabilities with downloaded maps
- **FR-016**: System MUST display continuous "expected time to finish" and "fastest time to finish" calculations
- **FR-017**: System MUST recommend route adjustments when riders are ahead of or behind schedule
- **FR-018**: System MUST allow manual route reordering and "skip to next point" functionality
- **FR-019**: System MUST enable photo capture at bonus point locations

**Scoring System**
- **FR-020**: System MUST allow scorers to locate riders quickly by name or rider number
- **FR-021**: System MUST accept rider-reported bonus points with approval/rejection capability (defaulting to approved)
- **FR-022**: System MUST automatically calculate points for individual bonus points and completed combinations
- **FR-023**: System MUST handle scoring discrepancies where riders claim points that cannot be verified
- **FR-024**: System MUST support multiple simultaneous scorers with data consolidation capability
