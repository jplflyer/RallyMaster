# Research: Motorcycle Rally Management System

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Decision: Kotlin Compose Multiplatform for Client Applications
**Rationale**: 
- Single codebase for all platforms (Desktop, iOS, Android, Web)
- Native performance and platform integration
- Unified UI framework with Compose declarative syntax
- Strong type safety and null safety from Kotlin
- Mature ecosystem with JetBrains backing

**Alternatives considered**:
- Flutter: Less native integration, Dart ecosystem smaller than Kotlin/Java
- React Native: JavaScript performance limitations, platform-specific bridge issues
- Native development: High maintenance burden with separate codebases

### Decision: Java Spring Boot for REST API
**Rationale**:
- Enterprise-grade framework with comprehensive features
- Excellent PostgreSQL integration via Spring Data JPA
- Built-in security, validation, and testing support
- Robust ecosystem for authentication (JWT), file handling, caching
- Easy deployment and monitoring capabilities

**Alternatives considered**:
- Kotlin Spring Boot: Same benefits but adds complexity mixing languages
- FastAPI/Django: Python ecosystem less familiar, different deployment patterns
- Node.js: JavaScript performance limitations for computational route optimization

### Decision: PostgreSQL for Primary Database
**Rationale**:
- ACID compliance for rally scoring and registration integrity
- JSON column support for flexible rally configuration storage
- Strong Spring Boot integration and tooling
- Proven performance at target scale (1000 concurrent users)
- Simple latitude/longitude storage as standard double fields

**Alternatives considered**:
- MySQL: Adequate but PostgreSQL has better JSON support
- MongoDB: Loss of ACID guarantees, complex relationship modeling
- SQLite: Insufficient for multi-user concurrent access patterns

### Decision: OpenStreetMap (OSM) via OSMDroid/Leaflet for Mapping
**Rationale**:
- Offline capability essential for rally navigation in remote areas
- No API key limits or usage costs compared to Google Maps
- Open source with community-driven updates
- Good routing capabilities via GraphHopper integration
- Cross-platform libraries available (OSMDroid for Android, platform bridges for iOS)

**Alternatives considered**:
- Google Maps: Expensive at scale, limited offline functionality, API dependencies
- MapBox: Costly, complex licensing, less offline support
- Apple Maps: iOS-only, limited customization and offline features

### Decision: Local JSON + PostgreSQL Hybrid Storage
**Rationale**:
- Rally Masters need option for local-only storage (privacy/security)
- Riders require offline data synchronization during rallies
- Scorers need real-time collaboration when connected
- JSON provides schema flexibility for rally rule variations
- PostgreSQL ensures data integrity for shared/collaborative scenarios

**Alternatives considered**:
- Cloud-only storage: Eliminates offline capability, creates vendor lock-in
- Local-only storage: Loses collaboration and backup benefits
- SQLite local + PostgreSQL remote: Added complexity of dual database management

## Architecture Patterns Research

### Decision: MVVM Pattern for Compose Multiplatform
**Rationale**:
- Natural fit with Compose's reactive state management
- Clear separation of UI logic from business logic
- Testability through ViewModels without UI dependencies
- Platform-agnostic business logic in shared modules

### Decision: Repository Pattern with Local/Remote Data Sources
**Rationale**:
- Essential for offline-first rally navigation requirements
- Clean abstraction between business logic and data persistence
- Supports seamless switching between local JSON and remote API
- Enables efficient data synchronization strategies

### Decision: Microservice-Style Modular Monolith
**Rationale**:
- Rally management, rider services, scoring can be logically separated
- Single deployment simplifies operations at current scale
- Clear module boundaries enable future extraction if needed
- Simplified data consistency within single database

## Integration Patterns

### Decision: REST API with JWT Authentication
**Rationale**:
- Stateless authentication suitable for mobile applications
- Standard HTTP patterns well-supported across platforms
- JWT enables offline token validation and role-based access
- Simple integration with Spring Security

### Decision: Eventual Consistency for Rally Data Synchronization
**Rationale**:
- Rally data changes infrequently once published
- Acceptable for riders to have slightly stale data during planning
- Conflict resolution for scoring can use timestamp-based strategies
- Reduces complexity compared to strong consistency requirements

### Decision: File-based Route Export (GPX, KML, CSV)
**Rationale**:
- Standard formats expected by rally community
- Integration with existing GPS devices and mapping software
- Simple implementation without complex API integrations
- Offline capability for route sharing

## Performance Considerations

### Decision: Progressive Map Tile Loading
**Rationale**:
- Essential for <100MB cache constraint per region
- Prioritize current route area for immediate availability
- Background download of adjacent tiles for seamless navigation
- Compression and cleanup of unused tiles

### Decision: Route Optimization via Traveling Salesman Algorithms
**Rationale**:
- Critical for competitive rally performance
- Approximation algorithms (nearest neighbor, 2-opt) provide good results
- Can be computed locally to avoid API dependencies
- Results cached and shareable between riders

### Decision: Reactive State Management
**Rationale**:
- Compose requires reactive patterns for efficient UI updates
- Real-time navigation updates need sub-second responsiveness  
- Battery optimization through selective screen updates
- Natural integration with Kotlin Coroutines and Flow

## Security Research

### Decision: Encrypted Local Storage for Sensitive Data
**Rationale**:
- Rally Master credentials and private rally data protection
- Device theft protection for rider location history
- Compliance with potential privacy regulations
- Android Keystore and iOS Keychain integration

### Decision: Role-Based Access Control (Rally Master, Rider, Scorer)
**Rationale**:
- Clear separation of concerns and capabilities
- Prevents accidental data corruption during scoring
- Supports rally-specific permissions (registered riders only)
- JWT claims can encode roles efficiently

## Testing Strategy Research

### Decision: Contract-First API Development
**Rationale**:
- OpenAPI specification enables frontend/backend parallel development
- Generated client code reduces integration errors
- Automated contract testing catches breaking changes early
- Documentation stays synchronized with implementation

### Decision: Testcontainers for Integration Testing
**Rationale**:
- Real PostgreSQL database testing vs. H2 differences
- Realistic environment for spatial query testing
- Docker-based isolation for parallel test execution
- CI/CD integration straightforward

### Decision: Offline-First Testing Strategy
**Rationale**:
- Critical user journeys must work without connectivity
- Mock network conditions during automated testing
- Local JSON data integrity validation
- Synchronization conflict testing scenarios
