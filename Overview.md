# RallyMaster Overview
This software is an aide to the entire process of running or participating
in a motorcycle rally. Some of the features can be used for any planned
rides, and some are specific to a rally.

# About Motorcycle Rallies

## Terms
* Rally: refers specifically to organized motorcycle ride of any duration.
* Bonus Point: In this use, point refers to a location or waypoint.
* Combination: A set of bonus points that score extra points if achieved.
Sometimes shortened to Combo.
* Rally Master: A rally organizer. Many rallies have more than 1 rally master.
* Rider: Anyone participating in the rally as a rider.
* Rally Book: a description of all bonus points with their point values
as well as all combinations.

## About Bonus Points
There is some confusion about bonus points. The word Point in a rally is used with two of the three common meanings:

* A location, such as a point of interest
* Points used for scoring

In a rally, a bonus points is worth scoring points, although it would be
rare to say "scoring". Thus, someone might say, "This bonus point is worth
25 points," or "these 5 bonus points are required for this Combination."

## An Example Rally
I will use a specific rally, the 2025 Dog Daze Rally held in Minnesota in
late August. This one-day rally was held in the Brainerd area. There was
a meeting Friday night where all riders were given instructions and their
rally books.

Saturday morning there was an obligatory 7 AM rider's meeting, and we were
released at exactly 8 AM.

To complete the rally successfully, we had to return to Rally Headquarters
no later than exactly 6 PM.

Except for one or two teams of riders, all riders planned and rode their
own routes. There was a bonus point worth 1000 points if riders were
present for a photo at 8:25, and then riders dispersed.

The goal of the rally was to earn the most points possible while riding
safely and returning on time. Each bonus point was worth from 10 to 75
points. The combinations were worth 150 to 1000 points, with 500 or
so being an average. The combinations required 1 stop for the photo stop
but 3 or more for the others.

In planning, riders would determine the route they wished to take. There
wasn't enough time to visit each stop or each each combination. I finished
in 8th place out of 22 riders (not bad for my first rally) with a score of
5037. I would have needed one more large combination to break into the
top 5. The winning rider had about 6700 points. In my ride, I visited
over 35 bonus points and completed 7 combos, counting the photo op.

## Scoring
Scoring requires sitting down with a scorer, who goes through my scoring
sheet. Proof of visiting each stop is required. This can come through
answering a question or taking a photo. In this ride, it was about
half and half.

Score sheets asked for starting odometer, rider name, rider number, and
ending odometer. Each stop was then listed by its code, odometer setting,
and points. The scorer verified everything and produced the total.


# About This Software
This software will eventually serve the entire rally process, but we're
going to start with the needs of the Rally Master, including scoring.
There will be two parts:

* A REST Server
* A Desktop Application

Outside of the immediate scope, we'll add:

* A Web UI to register on the site
* Desktop App: Additional features for rider planning
* A Mobile App to use while riding

# Additional Documents

* Technical.md: Describes some technical choices such as languages to use
* DesktopReqs.md: Requirements for the Desktop App
